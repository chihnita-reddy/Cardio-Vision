Project Highlights:

Machine Learning Model: Implemented a supervised learning model trained on a diverse dataset with various heart health indicators, including age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The model provides a risk score indicating the likelihood of heart disease.
Web Application Development: Used Flask to create a user-friendly interface where users can input health metrics and receive instant feedback on their risk level. This responsive and intuitive web application is accessible from any device with internet access.
Data Visualization: Integrated charts and graphs to present the results visually, allowing users to better understand their health profile and areas for improvement.
Security and Data Privacy: Ensured user data protection and compliance with standard privacy protocols, enhancing trust and usability.
Technical Stack: Python, Flask, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

Use Cases: Cardio-Vision is an innovative tool for preventive healthcare, enabling early risk detection and promoting proactive health management.

This project showcases expertise in machine learning, web development, and healthcare data analytics, making it a valuable resource for predictive health solutions.

_**Objectives:**_

The objective is to create a website that allows users to assess their risk of cardiovascular and heart diseases by considering their lifestyle and family history.
Users input lifestyle factors such as age, height, weight, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, and details about alcohol or smoking habits, along with their family history.
We use AI and machine learning to produce predictions based on the data provided by the user.
After generating predictions, we offer recommendations for medications and heart health improvements based on the individual's specific needs and circumstances.
