# Cardio-Vision
 Cardio-Vision is a web-based heart disease prediction system that leverages machine learning to assess individual risk factors.
Developed using Python, Flask, and a custom machine learning model, this project aims to provide an accessible tool for preliminary heart health evaluation, so healthcare providers make informed decisions.
Project Highlights:

Machine Learning Model: Implemented a supervised learning model trained on a diverse dataset with various heart health indicators, including age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The model provides a risk score indicating the likelihood of heart disease.


Web Application Development: Flask was used to create a user-friendly interface where users can input health metrics and receive instant feedback on their risk level. This responsive and intuitive web application is accessible from any device with internet access.

Data Visualization: Integrated charts and graphs to present the results visually, allowing users to better understand their health profile and areas for improvement.

Security and Data Privacy: Ensured user data protection and compliance with standard privacy protocols, enhancing trust and usability.

Technical Stack: Python, Flask, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

Use Cases: Cardio-Vision is an innovative tool for preventive healthcare, enabling early risk detection and promoting proactive health management.

This project showcases machine learning, web development, and healthcare data analytics expertise, making it a valuable resource for predictive health solutions.
